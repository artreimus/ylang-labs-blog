# DaVinci's Notebook Image Generator

_Built with ❤️ by [@artreimus](https://github.com/artreimus) from [Ylang Labs](https://github.com/ylang-labs)_

DaVinci-style inventor notebook renderer built on Next.js App Router. Provide a topic (or image), and the backend asks Gemini to craft a parchment illustration with ink annotations.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and `pnpm` (preferred for lockfile consistency).
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` available in your environment (see `.env.example`).

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# then open http://localhost:3000
```

To run a production build: `pnpm build` then `pnpm start`.

## Usage

1. Enter a topic such as “Clockwork orchard pollination rig.”
2. Click **Generate** to request a parchment-styled image. The prompt is trimmed server-side to keep outputs concise.
3. Regenerate or download the PNG once it renders.
4. Optionally supply an image; the API will transform it into the notebook style.

## Environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- Do not commit secrets; use local env files or deployment-specific secret stores.

## Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` — run the dev server.
- `pnpm build` — production bundle.
- `pnpm start` — serve the production build.
- `pnpm lint` — ESLint (Next.js/TypeScript).
